To implement fault tolerance (FT) in Kubernetes using leases, we ensure that critical tasks are reliably handled even if some components fail. This typically involves leader election, where one pod acts as the leader to perform certain tasks while others remain on standby. If the leader fails, a new leader is elected.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan to demonstrate fault tolerance using Kubernetes leases:

1. **Set up a Kubernetes Cluster:** Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Create a Namespace:** We'll create a separate namespace for our demonstration.
3. **Define a Lease Resource:** Create a Lease resource in Kubernetes.
4. **Create a Service Account and Role Binding:** Allow the pods to access and modify the Lease resource.
5. **Deploy the Leader Election Pods:** Deploy pods that will participate in leader election.
6. **Implement Leader Election Logic in Pods:** Pods will try to acquire the lease and act as leaders to perform the task.

### Step-by-Step Code Implementation

1. **Create a Namespace**

```yaml
# namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ft-demo
```

2. **Define a Lease Resource**

```yaml
# lease.yaml
apiVersion: coordination.k8s.io/v1
kind: Lease
metadata:
  name: ft-lease
  namespace: ft-demo
spec:
  holderIdentity: ""
  leaseDurationSeconds: 15
```

3. **Create a Service Account and Role Binding**

```yaml
# rbac.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: ft-sa
  namespace: ft-demo
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: ft-demo
  name: ft-role
rules:
- apiGroups: ["coordination.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["leases"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "update", "patch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: ft-rolebinding
  namespace: ft-demo
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: ft-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: ft-sa
  namespace: ft-demo
```

4. **Deploy the Leader Election Pods**

```yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ft-worker
  namespace: ft-demo
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ft-worker
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ft-worker
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: ft-sa
      containers:
      - name: ft-worker
        image: your-docker-image
        env:
        - name: NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        - name: LEASE_NAME
          value: "ft-lease"
        - name: POD_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.name
```

5. **Implement Leader Election Logic in Pods**

Create a script `worker.py` that will be used in the worker pods.

```python
import os
import time
from kubernetes import client, config
from kubernetes.client.rest import ApiException

def acquire_lease():
    namespace = os.getenv('NAMESPACE')
    lease_name = os.getenv('LEASE_NAME')
    holder_identity = os.getenv('POD_NAME')
    config.load_incluster_config()
    coordination_v1 = client.CoordinationV1Api()

    while True:
        try:
            lease = coordination_v1.read_namespaced_lease(lease_name, namespace)
            if lease.spec.holder_identity == holder_identity or lease.spec.holder_identity == "":
                lease.spec.holder_identity = holder_identity
                coordination_v1.replace_namespaced_lease(lease_name, namespace, lease)
                print(f"Lease acquired by {holder_identity}")
                return
            else:
                print(f"Lease held by {lease.spec.holder_identity}. Retrying...")
        except ApiException as e:
            print(f"Exception when calling CoordinationV1Api->read_namespaced_lease: {e}")
        time.sleep(5)

def perform_leader_task():
    print("Performing leader task...")
    time.sleep(10)  # Simulate task duration
    print("Leader task completed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    acquire_lease()
    perform_leader_task()
```

6. **Create a Docker Image and Push to a Registry**

Create a `Dockerfile` for the worker.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
RUN pip install kubernetes
COPY worker.py /worker.py
CMD ["python", "/worker.py"]
```

Build and push the Docker image.

```sh
docker build -t your-docker-image .
docker push your-docker-image
```

### Deployment

Deploy the resources to your Kubernetes cluster.

```sh
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f lease.yaml
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

This setup will ensure that the pods participate in leader election, with only one pod acting as the leader at any time. If the leader pod fails, a new leader will be elected.

**Next Steps:**
**a.** Add health checks to the leader task to ensure timely failover.
**b.** Implement logging and monitoring for leader election and task execution.
